This file presents our findings from applying various algorithms to the examples of randomly generated integer coefficient hyperplanes. The files ending with "nun" and "tim" contain the results obtained using different algorithms within the "function_standard" folder, showing the average number vertices and the time cunsuming. Similarly, the files ending with "linegraph" display the outcomes achieved through diverse algorithms in the "function_linegraph" folder recrod the number of found vertices periodically. The file "general data" represents the examples we used in those examples.

It is important to note that we obtained the "nun" and "tim" results simultaneously, and after obtain ehose results, we obtained the "linegraph" based on the file "tim". However, it is worth mentioning that due to limitations in hardware and thermal performance during the computations, there may be slight variations between our results and those obtained when running the algorithms for each example separately. Nevertheless, these differences should be not that large.
