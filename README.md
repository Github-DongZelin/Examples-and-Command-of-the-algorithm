# Examples and Command of the algorithm
These are commands and examples used in the algorithm of vertex enumeration.

The folder "examples" involving the randomly generated example and a simple example.

The folder "floating" and "symbolic" are commands in matlab that used in hypercubes and general examples respectively. They are almost same but use different type of veriables in calculation. In both command, there is another version end with " _ spanning tree", the file with this end will polt the spnning tree of generate all dictionaries, others will only give the result.

Every small function is inside the algorithm, and more detailed explination for each of them is inside the big function
