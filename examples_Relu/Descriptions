This file presents our findings from applying various algorithms to the example of cutting a cone out of a cube. The files ending with "poly", "arra" and "tim" contain the results obtained using different algorithms within the "function_polytope/arrangement" folder, "poly" and "arra" showing the average number vertices on polytope and arrangement respectively, and "tim" showing the time cunsuming. Similarly, the files ending with "linegraph" display the outcomes achieved through diverse algorithms in the "function_polytope/arrangement_linegraph" folder recrod the number of found vertices periodically.

The file "Datas of relu with input and hidden layer, more describe in the file 'generate all cells' " contain the weight vector and bais we use for the input and hiddenlayer. The file "Datas of relu information" contain the information of all cells and corresponding hyperplane arrangements. More detailed descriptions can be found in "Generate all cells and corresponding arrangement".

It is important to note that we obtained the "poly", "arra" and "tim" results simultaneously, and after obtain ehose results, we obtained the "linegraph" based on the file "tim". However, it is worth mentioning that due to limitations in hardware and thermal performance during the computations, there may be slight variations between our results and those obtained when running the algorithms for each example separately. Nevertheless, these differences should be not that large.
