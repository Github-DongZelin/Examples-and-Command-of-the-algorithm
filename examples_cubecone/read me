This file presents our findings from applying various algorithms to the example of cutting a cone out of a cube. The files ending with "nun" and "tim" contain the results obtained using different algorithms within the "function_standard" folder. Similarly, the files ending with "linegraph" display the outcomes achieved through diverse algorithms in the "function_linegraph" folder. The file "cube+cone data" represent the examples we used in those examples.

It is important to note that we obtained the "nun" and "tim" results simultaneously, and after obtain ehose results, we obtained the "linegraph". However, it is worth mentioning that due to limitations in hardware and thermal performance during the computations, there may be slight variations between our results and those obtained when running the algorithms for each example separately. Nevertheless, these differences should be not that large.
